SafePanda thrives in the Anji ecosystem. A token that is beautifully designed to reward long term holders. Wallets are forever growing, thanks to static rewards and the option to stake for Bamboo. With a 10% transaction fee, a portion of each transaction goes towards adopting Pandas with the WWF. As our future DEX grows with charity tokens joining, SafePanda will lead the way for a new breed of investors. An investor that not only cares about their profit margins, but one that wants to have a positive impact while reaching their financial goals.
